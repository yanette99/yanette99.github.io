    <p>The essay below was a persuasive essay I typed my sophomore year for my english class. The topic was based on if should underaged children be charged as adults. I went in depth as to why they should not be charged as adults. One of the main reasons as to why underaged children should not go to jail is because they will lack communication skills and instead of getting mentally better they are getting more ill.</p>
