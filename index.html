    <p>My name is Yanette Abzun and I am a junior here at Pasadena High School. Currently I volunteer at Huntington Hospital at the Maternity Department. There I help patients whenever they need anything like water or snacks. I volunteer at the hospital because in the future I want to be a part of the medical field and I want to get an inside view to see how it's like to work there. I also enjoy helping others. Another thing I enjoy doing is having fun little road trip to places. I enjoy road trips because there is a lot of beautiful scenery on the road. </p>
