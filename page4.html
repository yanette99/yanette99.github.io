    <p>For about five months now I've been volunteering at the Huntington Hospital in the Maternity Department. Already during the few months that I've been volunteering I've had wonderful experiences. One wonderful experience that I'd love to share is when the club I'm in called Hispanic National Honors Society, and I made gift baskets for all the nurses at Maternity. I've seen how hard working all the nurses are and we wanted to give back. In the future I would like to be a part and join the medical field. The medical field has always been something that has interested me ever since I was younger. </p>
